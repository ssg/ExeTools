# about

ExeTools is currently a PowerShell module that only provides the `Get-ExeArchitecture` cmdlet. I needed it on my
new Windows Dev Kit 2023 machine to see which are actually . To install it:

```
Install-Module ExeTools
```

# Get-ExeArchitecture

This function returns the target architecture of an executable binary file.
It uses .NET's native System.Reflection.PortableExecutable namespace so it probably doesn't recognize ARM64EC (x64 binaries that can be natively re-compiled into ARM64).

Since it's PortableExecutable specific at the moment, this function fails on ELF
binaries on Unix.

Example:

```
Get-ExeArchitecture *.exe
```

The output would resemble this:

```
Architecture Path
------------ ----
        I386 C:\temp\Autoruns.exe
       Amd64 C:\temp\Autoruns64.exe
       Arm64 C:\temp\Autoruns64a.exe
        I386 C:\temp\autorunsc.exe
       Amd64 C:\temp\autorunsc64.exe
       Arm64 C:\temp\autorunsc64a.exe
        I386 C:\temp\baslist.exe
       Amd64 C:\temp\bzip2.exe
        I386 C:\temp\certutil.exe
        I386 C:\temp\cloc.exe
        I386 C:\temp\Coreinfo.exe
       Amd64 C:\temp\cports.exe
       Amd64 C:\temp\curl.exe
       Amd64 C:\temp\depends.exe
        I386 C:\temp\disk2vhd.exe
        I386 C:\temp\gzip.exe
```

# Examples

Recurse subdirectories:

`dir *.exe -r | Get-ExeArchitecture`

Find all ARM64 binaries on your disk:

`dir *.exe -r | Get-ExeArchitecture | where { $_.Architecture -eq Arm64 }`

Find non-x64 executables currently running on the system:

`(ps).Path | ? { $_ } | Get-ExeArchitecture | ? { $_.Architecture -ne "Amd64" }`
